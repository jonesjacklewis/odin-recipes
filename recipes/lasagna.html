        <figcaption>Lasagne are a type of pasta, possibly one of the oldest types, made of very wide, flat sheets.
            Either term can also refer to an Italian dish made of stacked layers of lasagne alternating with fillings
            such as rag√π (ground meats and tomato sauce), vegetables, cheeses (which may include ricotta, mozzarella,
            and parmesan), and seasonings and spices, like Italian seasoning, such as garlic, oregano and basil. The
            dish may be topped with grated cheese, which becomes melted after baking. Typically, cooked pasta is
            assembled with the other ingredients and then baked in an oven. The resulting casserole is cut into
            single-serving square portions.</figcaption>

        <li>2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>&frac14; onion</li>
        <li>pinch freshly grated nutmeg</li>
        <li>50g butter</li>
        <li>50g plain flour</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Lasagne</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>14 sheets fresh lasagne pasta</li>
        <li>3 x 125g balls mozzarella, cut into small cubes</li>
        <li>small handful grated parmesan</li>
        <li>freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 tbsp butter</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 180&deg;C.</li>

        <li>For the ragu, heat the olive oil in a frying pan over a low heat and fry the celery, carrots and onion for
            approximately 15 minutes, until softened and golden. Add the garlic and rosemary and fry for two more
            minutes.</li>

        <li>Add the beef and pork mince and cook until the liquid from the meat has been absorbed.</li>

        <li>Pour in approximately 400ml of red wine and stir well. Cook for approximately 45 minutes.</li>

        <li>Once the wine has evaporated, add the tomatoes and stock. Leave the mixture uncovered to cook slowly for two
            hours. Top up with more warm stock if necessary. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste.
        </li>

        <li>To make the bechamel sauce, place the milk in a large non-stick saucepan, add the bay leaves, onion and
            nutmeg and gently bring to the boil.</li>

        <li>In a separate saucepan melt the butter and add the flour. Beat well and cook for two minutes. Remove the
            milk from the heat and add a little to the flour mixture. Combine well, and when all the milk has been
            absorbed, add a little more. Continue to do this until all the milk has been added, whisking continually.
        </li>

        <li>For the lasagne, blanch the pasta in salted boiling water for three minutes. Spoon a third of the bechamel
            sauce into the bottom of a lasagne dish in a layer, then place some of the pasta strips over the top. Follow
            this with some of the mozzarella and parmesan, and sprinkle over freshly ground black pepper. Follow with a
            layer of ragu. Repeat this step twice until all the ingredients have been used up. Dot knobs of butter over
            the surface and cook in the oven for 30 minutes, or until golden-brown on top and completely cooked through.
